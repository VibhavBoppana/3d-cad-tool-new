# ðŸ§Š 3D Modeller in Python

A lightweight 3D modelling tool built in Python using Legacy OpenGL and GLUT. This application demonstrates scene graphs, hierarchical rendering, interactive controls, and object manipulationâ€”all in under 500 lines of code.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Object-oriented scene graph with support for primitives and hierarchical nodes
- âœ… Render with Legacy OpenGL (via PyOpenGL)
- âœ… Real-time object placement, movement, scaling, and color cycling
- âœ… Ray-based object selection (picking) using AABB approximation
- âœ… Built-in primitives: Cube, Sphere, and a composite Snowman figure
- âœ… Simple keyboard and mouse interactions
